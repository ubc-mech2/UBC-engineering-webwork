BEGIN_PGML

A hair dryer is basically a duct of constant diameter in which a few layers of electric resistors are placed. A small fan pulls the air in and forces it through the resistors where it is heated. If the density of air is [$g1] [`kg / m^3`] at the inlet and [$g2] [`kg / m^3`] at the exit, determine the percent increase in the velocity of air as it flows through the dryer.

[@ image( "UBC-FLU-17-119.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

Percent increase = `v_\text{Out}/v_\text{In}` = [________]{$ans}[`%`]
