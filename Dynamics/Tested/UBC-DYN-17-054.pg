BEGIN_PGML

A steel bar is pinned at [`A`] and rotating at constant angular velocity [::omega_{A}::] [`= [$w]`] [`rad/s`] in the vertical plane. A brass collar located [`[$r]`] [`m`] away from the pin, of mass [`m= [$m]`] [`kg`], is moving along the bar with relative velocity [::v_{B"/"A}::][` = [$v]`] [`m/s`] to the right. The coefficient of friction between the bar and the mass is [`0.05`]. Find the relative acceleration, [::(a_{B"/"A})_{xyz}::] of the collar with respect to the bar (in [`m/`][::s^2::]) . Use [`g = 10`] [`m/`][::s^2::].

Hint: Write both the dynamic equations of motion and kinematic equations to solve this problem.
