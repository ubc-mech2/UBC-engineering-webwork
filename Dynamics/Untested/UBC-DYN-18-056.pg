Human dummies are used to analyze kinematics of human body motion for car crash or collision simulations. Use the following assumptions to find the velocity relative to the car with which the dummy's head is hitting the steering wheel.  
	[`\cdot`] Hips are fixed during the crash and upper body is freely pivoting about the hip  
	[`\cdot`] The equivalent mass above the hip is [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`]  
	[`\cdot`] Center of gravity for the equivalent mass above the hip is [`OG = [$rr]`] [`m`]  
	[`\cdot`] The distance between the forehead and the pivoting point [`r = [$r]`] [`m`]  
	[`\cdot`] The radius of gyration of the upper body about the hip is [`r_O = [$kO]`] [`m`]  
	[`\cdot`] The constant stopping deceleration of the vehicle is [`a = [$a]`] [`m/s^2`]  
	[`\cdot`] The angle of contact is [`\theta = [$theta]^{\circ}`]  

[`v = `][____]{"$v"} [`m/s`]
