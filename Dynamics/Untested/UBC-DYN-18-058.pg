Consider an ice skater with his arms horizontally and fully stretched with a rotational speed [`[$omega]`] [`rev/s`]. While he is rotating, he brings his arms into a vertical position and put them close to the centerline of his body. In this case, calculate the rotational speed of the ice skater's body.  

Use the following assumptions to calculate this rotational speed:  
	[`\cdot`] The total mass of the ice skater is [`m = [$mb] + [$ma]`] [`kg`]  
	[`\cdot`] The mass of each arm is [`[$ma]`] [`kg`]  
	[`\cdot`] When both arms are fully stretched, you can model the torso and the lower limb with a vertical solid cylinder  
	[`\cdot`] When both arms are fully stretched, you can model the arms with two horizontal solid cylinders attached to the body  
	[`\cdot`] When both arms are brought close to the centerline of the body, you can model the whole body with a vertical solid cylinder  

[`N = `][____]{"$N"} [`rev/s`]
