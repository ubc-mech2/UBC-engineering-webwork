BEGIN_PGML

Engineers are designing a passenger seat in a high-speed train. When the train is in motion, let a denote the train's acceleration along a straight section of track. The seat rotates about the point [`O`]. Let [`a`] denote the angular position of the seat (measured counterclockwise). Pictured is position [`\theta = 0^{\circ}`]. 

[@ image("UBC-DYN-18-079.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

A spring ([`k = [$k]`] [`N/m`]) and damper ([`c = [$c]`] [`Ns/m`]) are placed under the seat at distances [`B`] and [`A`] (measured in meters) from [`O`]. The seat and seatback have a constant width (into the page), dimensions [`l = [$l]`] [`m`] and [`h = [$h]`] [`m`], and a mass per unit length of [`[$m]`] [`kg/m`].

*a)* Assume that a [`[$mp]`] [`kg`] passenger sitting in the seat acts like a point mass located at [`G_{passenger}`] ([`\bar{x} = [$xbar]`] [`m`] and [`\bar{y} = [$ybar]`] [`m`]) and is rigidly attached to and moving with the seat due to a seat belt. The train accelerates at the rate [`a`] ([`m/s^2`]) as shown. Find the equation of motion of the seat/passenger system in terms of [`a`], [`A`], and [`B`]:

>>[``\ddot{\theta}+``][_____]{"$B"}[``\dot{\theta}+``][_____]{"$C"}[``\theta=``][_____]{"$D"}<<

*b)* The spring is placed at the seatback [`B = l = [$l]`] [`m`]. Where should the damper be placed so that the system is critically damped?

[`A=`] [_____]{"$A"} [`m`]
