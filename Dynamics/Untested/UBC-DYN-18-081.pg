BEGIN_PGML

Denise Mueller-Korenek broke the paced bicycle land speed record in September 2018, riding [`296`] [`km/hr`] directly behind a dragster (taking advantage of the wind break and aerodynamic pull of the vehicle). Her bike had only one very high gear setting, created with two chains and a series of chainrings and cogs, specifically designed for being able to pedal at high speeds. It was too high a gear setting to be able to start pedalling from rest, so she had to be towed up to a certain speed at which she could begin to pedal.

[@ image("UBC-DYN-18-081.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

Assume:
	[`\cdot`] No slip of chains on chainrings or cogs  
	[`\cdot`] No slip of the rear wheel on the ground  
	[`\cdot`] Chainring [`C`] and Cog [`B`] are rigidly fixed to the same shaft  

Dimensions:  
	[`\cdot`] Chainring [`A`] diameter [`=`] Chainring [`C`] diameter [`=`] [`[$dA]`] [`cm`]  
	[`\cdot`] Cog [`B`] diameter [`=`] Cog [`D`] diameter = [`[$dB]`] [`cm`]  
	[`\cdot`] Rear wheel diameter [`=`] [`[$dRear]`] [`cm`]  
	[`\cdot`] Crankarm length (centre of chainring to pedal) [`=`] [`[$crank]`] [`cm`]  

*a)* Assume that Mueller-Korenek could achieve a low cycling cadence of [`50`] [`rpm`] (that is, [`50`] complete revolutions of a pedal in one minute) once the dragster had towed her up to a certain speed.  What was her ground speed when she was able to start pedaling at [`50`] [`rpm`]?  

[`\vec{v_i}=`] [_____]{"$vi"} [`m/s`]  

*b)* What was her cadence at her final velocity of [`296`] [`km/hr`]?

[`\omega_f=`] [_____]{"$omegaF"} [`rad/s`]  

*c)* What was the velocity of her pedal centre of gravity, [`\vec{v_p}`], (located where the pedal connects to the crankarm) when the crankarm is pointing toward the rear wheel?  

[`\vec{v_p}=`] [_____]{"$vp"} [`m/s`]
