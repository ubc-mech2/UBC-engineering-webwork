A beam with a guided support and [`[$L]`] [`m`] span supports a distributed load of intensity [`q = [$q]`] [`kN/m`] over its first half (see figure part *a*) and a moment [`M_0 = [$m0]`] [`kNm`] at joint [`B`]. The beam consists of a wood member actual dimensions [`[$b]`] [`mm`] [`\times`] [`[$h1]`] [`mm`] in cross section, as shown in the figure part *b*) that is reinforced by [`[$t]`] [`mm`] thick steel plates on top and bottom. The moduli of elasticity for the steel and wood are
[`E_s = [$es]`] [`GPa`] and [`E_w = [$ew]`] [`GPa`], respectively.
1. 	Calculate the maximum bending stresses [`\sigma_s`], in the steel plates and [`\sigma_w`] in the wood member due to the applied loads.
2. 	If the allowable bending stress in the steel plates is [`\sigma_{as} = [$as]`] [`MPa`] and that in the wood is [`\sigma_{aw} = [$aw]`] [`MPa`], find [`q_{max}`]. (Assume that the moment at [`b`], [`M_0`], remains at [`[$m0]`] [`kNm`].)
3. 	If [`q = [$q]`] [`kN/m`] and allowable stress values in part 2 apply, what is [`M_{0_{max}}`] at [`B`]?

[`\sigma_s=`] [_____]{"$ss"} [`MPa`]  
[`\sigma_w=`] [_____]{"$sw"} [`MPa`]  
[`q_{max}=`] [_____]{"$qmax"} [`kN/m`]  
[`M_{0_{max}}=`] [_____]{"$m0max"} [`kNm`]
