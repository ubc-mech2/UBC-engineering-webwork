A freight-car axle [`AB`] is loaded approximately as shown in the figure, with the forces [`P`] representing the car loads (transmitted to the axle through the axle boxes) and the forces [`R`] representing the rail loads (transmitted to the axle through the wheels). The diameter of the axle is [`d = [$d]`] [`mm`], the distance between the centers of the rails is [`L`] and the distance between the forces [`P`] and [`R`] is [`b = [$b]`] [`mm`].

Calculate the maximum bending stress [`\sigma_{max}`] in the axle if [`P = [$p]`] [`kN`]

[`\sigma_{max}=`] [_____]{"$Ans"} [`MPa`]
