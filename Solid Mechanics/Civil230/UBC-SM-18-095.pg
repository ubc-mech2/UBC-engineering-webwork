Prestressed concrete beams are sometimes manufactured in the following manner. High-strength steel wires are stretched by a jacking mechanism that applies a force [`Q`], as represented schematically in part *a* of the figure. Concrete is then poured around the wires to form a beam, as shown in part *b*.

After the concrete sets properly, the jacks are released and the force [`Q`] is removed (see part *c* of the figure). Thus, the beam is left in a prestressed condition, with the wires in tension and the concrete in compression.

Let us assume that the prestressing force [`Q`] produces in the steel wires an initial stress [`\sigma_0 = [$sigma0]`]  [`MPa`]. If the moduli of elasticity of the steel and concrete are in the ratio [`[$e]: 1`] and the cross-sectional areas are in the ratio [`1:[$a]`], what are the final stresses [`\sigma_s`], and [`\sigma_c`] in the two materials?

[`\sigma_s=`] [_____]{"$s"} [`MPa`]  
[`\sigma_c=`] [_____]{"$c"} [`MPa`]
