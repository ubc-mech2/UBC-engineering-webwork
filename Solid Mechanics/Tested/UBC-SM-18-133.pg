A laminated wood beam on simple supports (figure part *a*) is built up by gluing together, four [`[$h]`] [`mm`] [`\times [$b]`] [`mm`] [`\times`] boards (actual dimensions) to form a solid beam [`[$b]`] [`mm`] [`\times`] [`[$h*4]`] [`mm`] in cross section, as shown in the figure part *b*. The allowable shear stress in the glued joints is [`[$tg]`] [`kPa`], the allowable shear stress in the wood is [`[$tw]`] [`MPa`], and the allowable bending stress in the wood is [`[$sig]`] [`MPa`].
1. 	if the beam is [`[$L]`] [`m`] long, what is the allowable load [`P`] acting at the one-third point along the beam, as shown? (Include the effects of the beam's own weight, assuming that the wood weighs [`[$gamma]`] [`kN/m^3`])
2. 	Repeat part 1 if the beam is assembled by gluing together two [`[$h2]`] [`mm`] x [`[$b]`] [`mm`] boards and a [`[$h]`] [`mm`] [`\times`] [`[$b]`] [`mm`] board (see figure part *c*).
